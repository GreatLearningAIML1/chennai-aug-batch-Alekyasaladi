If you feel you can not\\ndiscuss this with your boss, perhaps your company has a personnel\\ndepartment that can work for you while preserving your privacy.  Most\\ncompanies will want to deal with this problem because constant anxiety\\ndoes seriously affect how effectively employees do their jobs.\\n\\nIt is unclear from your letter if you have done this or not.  It is\\nnot inconceivable that management remains ignorant of employee\\nproblems/strife even after eight years (it's a miracle if they do\\nnotice).  Perhaps your manager did not bring to the attention of\\nhigher ups?  If the company indeed does seem to want to ignore the\\nentire problem, there may be a state agency willing to fight with\\nyou.  (check with a lawyer, a women's resource center, etc to find out)\\n\\nYou may also want to discuss this with your paster, priest, husband,\\netc.  That is, someone you know will not be judgemental and that is\\nsupportive, comforting, etc.  This will bring a lot of healing.\\n\\n>So I returned at 11:25, only to find that ever single\\n>person had already left for lunch.
